# Aimlytics
Aimlytics is a computer vision-based scoring system designed to analyze target images and compute
precise decimal scores automatically, according to the **ISSF** rules for **C10 and P10 shooting**.

This project was developed with **Opencv** for the _Signal, Image and Video_ exam in the AIS master degree at the University of Trento.


## Features
* Automatic target detection

* **Perspective correction**: dynamically adjusts the target perspective for accurate analysis.

* Bullet hole detection: recognizes and isolates bullet holes using image processing techniques.

* **Scoring computation**
